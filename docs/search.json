    "text": "3. Teaching Philosophy\n\n\n\nI believe every person’s teaching philosophy begins with their respective learning experiences across their academic life. Therefore, I define teaching as a meticulous and flexible process that must be adapted to the students’ background expertise level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis flexibility can be achieved in conjunction with diverse team building and technological tools. Moreover, I always strive to incorporate robust conceptual frameworks at any statistical course level.",
