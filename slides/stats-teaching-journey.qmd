## <span style="color: darkblue;">Something about me...

![](img/photo-alexi.jpg){.absolute top=-60 right=-60 height="180"}

- I am an Assistant Professor of Teaching.
- My graduate teaching is focused on the  <span style="color: purple;">Master of Data Science (MDS)</span>, specifically in Statistics.
- My undergraduate teaching has been focused on <span style="color: purple;">scientific communication</span>.
- I am somehow still active in my core PhD research area: <span style="color: purple;">Spatio-temporal data modelling (such as Gaussian stochastic processes)</span>.

# <span style="color: darkblue;">Agenda</span>

1. Statistical Food for Thought
2. Overview of the Teaching Journey
3. Teaching Philosophy
4. A Practical Teaching Case: DSCI 562
5. Challenges Ahead

## <span style="color: darkblue;">1. Statistical Food for Thought</span>

- We can view Statistics as an <span style="color: purple;">auxiliary science</span> that helps us to learn helpful <span style="color: purple;">population/system</span> insights through <span style="color: purple;">sampled data</span>.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">How can we visualize it?</span>

### <span style="color: darkblue;">The Importance of Statistical Inference</span>

- Inference allows us to get these population/system insights via sample data and <span style="color: purple;">a whole toolbox of statistical methods</span>.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Postdoctoral Teaching and Learning Fellow (2021-2023)</span>

![](img/UBC-MDS-logo.png){.absolute top=50 right=-60 height="170"}

:::: incremental
- <span style="color: purple;">**MDS**</span> A 10-month accelerated professional program
- 24 one-credit courses distributed across six blocks
- A subset of these courses falls on the statistical side:

  1. **DSCI 551:** Descriptive Statistics and Probability for Data Science.
  2. **DSCI 552:** Statistical Inference and Computation I (frequentist).
  3. **DSCI 553:** Statistical Inference and Computation II (Bayesian).
  4. **DSCI 554:** Experimentation and Causal Inference.
  5. **DSCI 561:** Regression I (ordinary least-squares, OLS).
  6. <span style="color: purple;">**DSCI 562:** Regression II (**beyond OLS**)</span>.

## <span style="color: darkblue;">3. Teaching Philosophy</span>

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
> *I believe every person's teaching philosophy begins with their respective <span style="color: purple;">learning experiences</span> across their academic life. Therefore, I define teaching as <span style="color: purple;">a meticulous and flexible process</span> that must be adapted to the <span style="color: purple;">students' background expertise level</span>.*
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
> *This flexibility can be achieved in conjunction with diverse <span style="color: purple;">team building</span> and <span style="color: purple;">technological tools</span>. Moreover, I always strive to incorporate robust conceptual frameworks at any statistical course level.*

### <span style="color: darkblue;">A Data Science Science-oriented Statistical Teaching</span>

- Effective learning can be achieved using <span style="color: purple;">transparent</span>, <span style="color: purple;">reproducible</span>, <span style="color: purple;">collaborative</span>, and <span style="color: purple;">flexible tools</span> with a <span style="color: purple;">solid theoretical basis</span> via exciting and challenging data inquiries.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">More specifically...</span>

::::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
:::: incremental
- <span style="color: purple;">**Efficient student teamwork via data science tools.**</span> It is crucial to pose food-for-thought exercises that will get all teams into deep discussions about any given statistical topic.
- <span style="color: purple;">**Adaptive statistical teaching.**</span> One needs to tune the level of challenge accordingly.
- <span style="color: purple;">**Incorporation of research and data science-related topics.**</span> Using my PhD research as a pivot point for different teaching materials.
- <span style="color: purple;">**Collaborative and reproducible teaching tools.**</span> All this development is done through repositories on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/), [**Jupyter notebooks**](https://jupyter.org/), and [**Jupyter books**](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).
- <span style="color: purple;">**Foundational theoretical basis.**</span> Comprehensive contributions with theoretical elements across different teaching materials (such as [**DSCI 562**](https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI_562_regr-2/README.html)).
- <span style="color: purple;">**Continuous communication.**</span> The use of communication platforms such as [**Slack**](https://slack.com/).

## <span style="color: darkblue;">4. A Practical Teaching Case: DSCI 562</span>

- There are **eight** lectures, **four** labs, and **two** exams.
- How can we cover <span style="color: purple;">generalized linear models (GLMs)</span>, <span style="color: purple;">mixed-effects</span>, <span style="color: purple;">local</span>, <span style="color: purple;">survival</span>, and <span style="color: purple;">quantile regression</span>, and <span style="color: purple;">techniques for dealing with missing data</span> **across eight lectures in four weeks**?

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Three Pillars in Regression Teaching</span>

::: incremental
- **DSCI 562** targets Regression Analysis for **complex data**.
- Given the amount of material to cover, <span style="color: purple;">lectures are usually quite dense</span>.
- Therefore, it is imperative to have an <span style="color: purple;">efficient and homogeneous teaching approach</span> that relies on <span style="color: purple;">three pillars</span>.
:::

![](img/crab.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">The pillars</span>

::: incremental
1. The use of a <span style="color: purple;">Data Science workflow</span>.
2. Choosing a <span style="color: purple;">proper workflow flavour</span> according to either an <span style="color: purple;">inferential</span> or <span style="color: purple;">predictive</span> paradigm.
3. The correct use of an appropriate regression model based on the response of interest (<span style="color: purple;">when to use what as a mind map</span>).

## <span style="color: darkblue;">5. Challenges Ahead</span>

:::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
::: incremental
1. <span style="color: purple;">Open Educational Resources (OERs)</span> are still heavily needed in Machine Learning, Statistics, and Data Science.
2. We are currently working on that! [**The Regression Cookbook**](https://alexrod61.github.io/regression-cookbook/) is our first approach!
3. Another project is on the way: **The Hypothesis Testing Mini Cookbook**.
4. Keep exploring new ways to deliver audiovisual teaching materials such as [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HPu1mmO4Oo) using [**UBC Studios**](https://ubcstudios.ubc.ca/).
5. Expand <span style="color: purple;">our current statistical curriculum</span> via external collaborations.
